Snowshoe PCBs
=============

Snowshoe Single Keyswitch Hotswap Boards

Some very simple PCBs to make it easier to work with Kailh MX or Choc hotswap sockets.

I've used Kailh MX hotswap sockets in my keyboard designs for a while; I really value the flexibility of being able to
swap out my switches. However, since my keyboard designs are not flat, I can't just use a standard full-size PCB for my
keyboard. This allows me to have individual PCBs for each switch for better support, and makes it easier to solder to
them instead of having to solder leads to the hotswap sockets directly.

This was directly inspired by my work on [the Dactyl Lynx keyboard][], and the latest version of that keyboard uses
these boards. (37 per side)
